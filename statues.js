/*

Given array of statue heights, and an array of cave heights, find max number of statues that can fit in the cave.

You can only insert into the cave from the opening (which is at index 0), and slide as necessary.

For example,
statues = [1,2,3]
cave = [2,1,1]

Answer: 2 because statue of height 1 can slide all the way to the back of the cave, and statue of height 2 can slide into the opening of the cave.

Another example,
statues = [5]
cave = [1,20,20]

Answer: 0 because the statue of height 5 cannot get past the opening of the cave (which is height 1).
